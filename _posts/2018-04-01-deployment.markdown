Reference:

[Jekyll on Heroku][jekyll-on-heroku]

Explanations:

Older version of Ruby runs well. There is no need to install the latest version.

The [ruby "2.4.2"] can be replaced by [ruby RUBY_VERSION] if it's not your wish to check its version.

Deprecated:

I build one blog a year ago and took this article as reference. But it seems not working after Heroku updates itself.
